1. Upload the FirstCommitDB table on Google Big Query and run the following SQL to get GHURL for each git project:

SELECT a.PostId, a.Repo, a.RepoName, a.FileId, a.SOUrl, GHUrl, a.Hash, CommiterDate
 FROM `my-project-320919.First.FirstCommitDB` AS a,
`sotorrent-org.2020_01_24.PostReferenceGH` AS b
WHERE 
a.PostId=b.PostId and 
a.Repo=b.Repo and 
a.RepoName=b.RepoName and 
a.FileId=b.FileId

Download the table and save it as ‘getting_ghurl.csv’



2. Similarly, upload this file on Google Big Query and run the following SQL to find Revision GUUID and Creation Dates of Stack Overflow Posts:

SELECT a.PostId, a.Repo, a.RepoName, a.FileId,   a.SOUrl, GHUrl,  a.Hash, CommiterDate, RevisionGUID, CreationDate
FROM `my-project-320919.First.getting_ghurl` AS a,
`sotorrent-org.2020_01_24.PostHistory` AS b
where 
a.PostId=b.PostId

Download the table and save it as ‘moreinfo.csv’. 




3. Similarly, upload this file on Google Big Query and run the following SQL to calculate the date difference between Creation and Commiter Date:

SELECT i.PostId, i.Repo,    i.RepoName, i.FileId,   i.SOUrl,    i.GHUrl,    i.Hash, i.CommiterDate, i.CreationDate, DATE_DIFF(i.CommiterDate, i.CreationDate, minute) as DateDiff, i.RevisionGUID
FROM `my-project-320919.First.moreinfo` AS i
WHERE DateDiff>0

Download the table and save it as 'datediff.csv'




4. Similarly, upload this file on Google Big Query and run the following SQL to find Stack Overflow Posts whose creation/revision date is closet to commit date of the git project:

SELECT tbl.*
FROM `my-project-320919.First.datediff` AS tbl
  INNER JOIN
  (
    SELECT PostId, Repo, RepoName,FileId,SOUrl, GHUrl, a.Hash, CommiterDate, MIN(DateDiff) MinPoint
    FROM `my-project-320919.First.datediff` AS a
    GROUP BY PostId,Repo, RepoName, FileId, SOUrl, GHUrl, a.Hash, CommiterDate
  ) tbl1
  ON tbl1.FileId = tbl.FileId
  AND tbl1.PostId = tbl.PostId
  AND tbl1.Repo = tbl.Repo
  AND tbl1.RepoName = tbl.RepoName
  AND tbl1.PostId = tbl.PostId
WHERE tbl1.MinPoint = tbl.DateDiff

ORDER BY PostId ASC

Download the table and save it as 'file_found.csv'
